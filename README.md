# Wolfram_Rules_In_Cubelets
Flashlights and rotate cubelets programming process to play the wolfram rules

The board is constructed with Cubelets Robots: 18 flashlights and 18 rotates (board of 6x6). Each change is 1000 milliseconds. It is inspired by the Wolfram Rules numer, 15, 22, 30, 57, 60, 110, 184, 220.

Each folder contains the codes used for the cubelets used. If you wish to use them, you must change the serial numbers according to your own arrangement. It is also important to be careful when placing them, otherwise inconsistent results will occur.

in each folder you will find:

Note: it should work so the change is continuous and works as if the board were infinite, but in testing, it truncates at the walls.
